                also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin,
                Suga,
                J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip
                hop group,
                their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused
                on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the
                journey
                towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and
                adjacent
                work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate
                universe storyline.</p>

                Lee Soo-man in 2005 as a 12-piece group with rotational members but the concept was abandoned after
                addition
                of Kyuhyun in 2006. They are also dubbed by the media as the "King of Hallyu Wave" due to their
                prominent
                contributions in Korean Wave</p>
